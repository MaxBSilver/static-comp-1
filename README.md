# Static Comp 1 Challenge

## Motivation
This project was created as part of the Turing School of Software and Design Module 1 Frontend curriculum. This project is intended to increase the developers knowledge of CSS flexbox, responsiveness, and the importance of attention to detail. This project is intended to maintain the layout of the given static comp (displayed below) but creative liberties were given for the content.
